# Simple JavaScript Drills

This project is designed to help you get used to writing functions in JavaScript and thinking about logic. There are tests in the "tests" directory.

Once you have completed the methods and you think they are correct, you can run `npm test` from the command line to see if your code passes the tests. There are also scripts to run specific tests, found below.

## Getting Started

Before you do anything you need to run the following command:

`npm install`

There are a bunch of component files in "components" directory. Your job is to fill in the logic for all of the functions. Each function/method has corresponding documentation that tells you what the function should do. When the function is complete, it should pass an associated test.

### To run all tests

`npm test`

### To run specific tests

`npm run test:arrays`

`npm run test:objects`

`npm run test:numbers`

`npm run test:strings`

## Important Note

Some methods build off of others, you can always call those methods to reuse logic you have already written!
